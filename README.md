# NOTES 

## Keywords

* JavaScript's variable declaration keywords
    * `var` - declare as global scope
    * `let` - declare as local scope
    * `const` - reference can't be changed & must initialize with declaration but can be reassigned
* Assignment - with assignment operator `=`
* Initialization - declare and assign value such as 
```TS 
let myVar = 123
```

## Data Types

> Is the type of variable's value

In JavaScript, this is known as *JavaScript data primitives* meaning lower-level data types provided by JavaScript
* `string` 
* `number`
* `bigint`
* `boolean`
* `undefined`
* `symbol`

### Common Operators for numeric types

* `+`
* `-`
* `*`
* `/`
* `%`

### Common characters for `string` type

* `'` & `"` are allow for representing string characters
* `Template literals` - `${}` is use to represent variable in a string

## Modular code with Function

Components: declaration, parameters, & return

* camelCase

### callback

To create a function from another function because not knowing of *when* the function should be run usually for asynchronous function

### Anonymous function

A function without a name usually used for callback to help avoid 'namespace pollution'

### Arrow functions

Uses `=>` to represent function rather than calling `function` keyword

## Decision Making

> This can be done by using `if/else` statement and/or logical operators

### Ternary Operator

```JS
let variable = condition ? <return this if true> : <return this if false>
```

## Arrays & Loops

### Manipulate Arrays

- Access items: `array[<number>]`
- change value: use assignment operator `=`
- add more values: `push()` method
- array length: `length` field
- remove a value: `delete` 
- remove an item: `splice()` method 

### For loop

Require 3 parts to iterate:

* counter 
* condition
* increment expression

```JS
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

### While loop

```JS
//Counting up to 10
let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
 console.log(i);
 i++;
}
```

### `forEach` loop

> A method for array

```JS
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.forEach(number => console.log(number)); // 1 2 3 4 5

numbers.forEach((number, index) => console.log(`Number ${number} ${index}`));
```

The difference between `forEach` and `for` loops is that `for` loop allows abruptly exit with `break` statement, while `forEach` does not allow.

```JS
let numbers = [1, 2, -1, 4, 5];
for(let i = 0; i< numbers.length; i++>) {
  if (numbers[i] < 0) {
    break;
  }
  console.log(numbers[i]);
}
```

### Other kind of methods for array looping

* for...of
* `map()`

### Use Operations to Query array

#### Filtering

> Using `find()` method to find item

```JS
let iceCreamFlavors = ["Chocolate", "Strawberry", "Vanilla", "Pistachio", "Neapolitan", "Mint Chip"];
iceCreamFlavors.find(flavor => flavor === "Chocolate") // "Chocolate"
```

> Using `filter` for filtering items

```JS
let iceCreamFlavors = [
  { name: "Chocolate", type: "Chocolate" }, 
  { name: "Strawberry", type: "fruit"}, 
  { name: "Vanilla", type: "Vanilla"}, 
  { name: "Pistachio", type: "Nuts"}, 
  { name: "Neapolitan", type: "Chocolate"}, 
  { name: "Mint Chip", type: "Chocolate"}
];

iceCreamFlavors.filter(flavor => flavor.type === "Chocolate") // [{ name: "Chocolate", type: "Chocolate" }, { name: "Neapolitan", type: "Chocolate"}, { name: "Mint Chip", type: "Chocolate"}]
```

> Check condition with `some()` method

```JS
iceCreamFlavors.some(flavor => flavor.type === "Nuts") // true

iceCreamFlavors.filter(flavor => flavor.type !== "Nuts") // returns everything except for Pistachio.
```

#### Projections map

> Projection means you are trying to change your array in some ways and in this case is through `map()` method

```JS
let iceCreamFlavors = [
  { name: "Chocolate", type: "Chocolate" }, 
  { name: "Strawberry", type: "fruit"}, 
  { name: "Vanilla", type: "Vanilla"}, 
  { name: "Pistachio", type: "Nuts"}, 
  { name: "Neapolitan", type: "Chocolate"}, 
  { name: "Mint Chip", type: "Chocolate"}
];
iceCreamFlavors.map(flavor => {
  flavor.price = 1;
  return flavor;
}) // every item now has a new property price: 1
```

#### Aggregations

For loop can used to aggregate an array for values, but this can be done with `reduce` method for more elegant approach

```JS
let sum = 0;
for( let i =0; i< sales.length; i++) {
  sum += sales[i].amount; 
}

// VS
